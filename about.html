                Born from the ashes of a my ancestors before me I emerged a creature devoid of life. Fast foward 24 years 
                and I continue to search the void for answers, but all I hear are echos. 
                Ultimately I grew weary and went to school. Got an AA in Business Admin, a BS in Information 
                Technology and hopefully MS in software engineering or potentially Data Science.   </p>
