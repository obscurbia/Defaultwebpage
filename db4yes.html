                Nothing new to report here on the homefront. 
                It feels like days since I've spoken to another human. 
                Truth be told it has been no more than 4 hours since I last visted Target for supplies.
                The quarantine has a strange affect on a person. 
                Simply being told not to actively lick doornobs makes them look delicious. 
                I guess it's the American way.
