                None of very good however, so I'll just start by introducing myself. My name is Daniel Atlas Uvina and I'm a recent grdauate from an online IT Program. 
                I started taking other various online degree programs in order to beef up my resume and to fill in gaps on things I didn't learn form my BS program. 
                So far I have completed Data Science certificate, and am in the process (albiet behind) of completing the front-end web development nanodgreee from Udacity.  </p>
